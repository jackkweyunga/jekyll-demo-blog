## The Power of Git Rebase

Git rebase is a powerful tool for managing commits in a branch. It helps you:

1. **Clean Up History**: Rebase can squash multiple commits into a single commit, making your history cleaner.
2. **Keep a Linear History**: By rebasing instead of merging, you maintain a linear project history, which is easier to follow.
3. **Resolve Conflicts Early**: Rebasing brings changes from the base branch into your feature branch, allowing you to resolve conflicts before merging.

To use rebase:

```bash
git checkout feature-branch
git rebase main
```
