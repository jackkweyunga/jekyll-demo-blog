## Mastering Flexbox in CSS

Flexbox is a powerful CSS layout module that makes it easier to design flexible and responsive layouts.

### Key Flexbox Concepts:

1. **Flex Container**: The parent element that holds the flex items. Set it up using `display: flex;`.
   
   ```css
   .container {
       display: flex;
   }
  ```
