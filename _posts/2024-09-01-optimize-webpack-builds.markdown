## Optimizing Your Webpack Build for Production

When preparing your application for production, optimizing your Webpack build can significantly improve performance. Here are a few tips:

1. **Minify Your Code**: Use `terser-webpack-plugin` to minify JavaScript files, reducing their size.
2. **Enable Code Splitting**: Split your code into smaller chunks to load only whatâ€™s necessary.
3. **Tree Shaking**: Remove unused code by enabling tree shaking in your Webpack config.
4. **Optimize Images**: Use `image-webpack-loader` to compress and optimize images.

These steps will help reduce your bundle size and improve load times.
