<p>When preparing your application for production, optimizing your Webpack build can significantly improve performance. Here are a few tips:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Minify Your Code</strong>: Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">terser-webpack-plugin</code> to minify JavaScript files, reducing their size.</li>
  <li><strong>Enable Code Splitting</strong>: Split your code into smaller chunks to load only whatâ€™s necessary.</li>
  <li><strong>Tree Shaking</strong>: Remove unused code by enabling tree shaking in your Webpack config.</li>
  <li><strong>Optimize Images</strong>: Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">image-webpack-loader</code> to compress and optimize images.</li>
</ol>

<p>These steps will help reduce your bundle size and improve load times.</p>
