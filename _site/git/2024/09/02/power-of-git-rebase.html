<p>Git rebase is a powerful tool for managing commits in a branch. It helps you:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Clean Up History</strong>: Rebase can squash multiple commits into a single commit, making your history cleaner.</li>
  <li><strong>Keep a Linear History</strong>: By rebasing instead of merging, you maintain a linear project history, which is easier to follow.</li>
  <li><strong>Resolve Conflicts Early</strong>: Rebasing brings changes from the base branch into your feature branch, allowing you to resolve conflicts before merging.</li>
</ol>

<p>To use rebase:</p>
